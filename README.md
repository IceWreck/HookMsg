# HookMsg

Create webhooks (remote triggers) to execute scripts (bash, python, whatever) on your machine (kind of like a simpler [CGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface)). It also acts like a notification system and gotify alternative.

**Optional Requirements:**
* A matrix homeserver like Dendrite.
* Telegram bot api key for tg messages.
* SMTP server for emails.
